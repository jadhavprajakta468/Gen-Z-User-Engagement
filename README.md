# Gen-Z-User-Engagement Project


### Problem Statement
The challenge is to build engagement constructs on a platform that resonates with younger audiences, focusing on fashion to drive habitual use and virality.

### Solution Overview
We have implemented several features aimed at enhancing user engagement and interaction on the platform:

1. **AI Chatbot Integration**:
   - An AI chatbot assists users with product searches, availability inquiries, sizing, style suggestions, and pricing details.
   - It offers personalized fashion recommendations based on user preferences and browsing history, improving overall user experience.

2. **Engaging User Activities**:
   - **Prediction Games**: Users predict upcoming fashion trends to earn rewards based on their accuracy.
   - **Fashion Challenges**: Encourages users to create themed outfits; winners are determined through community voting and receive rewards.
   - **Trend Spotting Quests**: Turns trendspotting into a game where users earn points or rewards for identifying new trends within the app.

3. **Augmented Reality (AR) Try-On**:
   - Utilizes smartphone cameras and advanced AR technology to enable users to virtually try on clothes, shoes, and accessories.
   - Users can mix and match items to create outfits and visualize how they look together, aiding in decision-making during shopping.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework and Database-MySQL

### Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Seamless shopping experience with AI-driven assistance and interactive features.
- **Increased Engagement**: Through gamification and AR try-on, keeping users returning to the app.
- **Virality**: Encouraging community interaction and sharing through challenges and trends.
